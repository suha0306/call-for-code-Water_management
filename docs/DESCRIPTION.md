Industrial wastewater treatment describes the processes used for treating wastewater that is produced by industries as an undesirable by-product  After treatment, the treated industrial wastewater (or effluent) may be reused or released to a sanitary sewer or to a surface water in the environment. Most industrial processes, such as petroleum refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants have onsite facilities to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated wastewater comply with the regulations regarding disposal of wastewaters into sewers or into rivers, lakes or oceans.Recent trends have been to minimize such production or to recycle treated wastewater within the production process of the sources of industrial wastewater include battery manufacturing, electric power plants, food industry, iron and steel industry, mines and quarries, nuclear industry, oil and gas extraction, organic chemicals manufacturing, petroleum refining and petrochemicals, pulp and paper industry, smelters, textile mills, industrial oil contamination, water treatment, wood preserving.

## Section 1

Some waste waters from industrial or agricultural processes may also contain chemicals that may be hazardous to the environment or to public health and which need to be neutralized or removed from the water before it can be safely reintroduced into the environment.These chemical processes, which induce chemical reactions, are called chemical unit processes and are used alongside biological and physical cleaning processes to achieve various water standards.

### Subsection 1.1
Neutralization involves the addition of chemicals for the purpose of adjusting the pH of the waste water. This involves the addition of acids (to lower pH) or alkalis (to raise pH) depending on the initial pH of the influent. From Machine-learning techniques can aid in designing wastewater treatment.


### Subsection 1.2

Techniques used in the machine-learning field accelerate data analysis and pattern recognition, allowing development of predictive models that can be used to forecast the design and behaviors of parts and processes.When put to work, machine-learning algorithms generate models of a system, process or part using training dataâ€”historic data compiled from theory-based calculations performed through simulations or from observation. Researchers employ trained machine-learning models to make predictions based on new, unidentified or unlabeled data. Once the results was interacts with the chatbot will help to give the message about the water should be released are not , this ensures that water is not released without being treated. This way we can reduce the water pollution

## Conclusion

Predictive analytics analyses current and historical facts to make predictions about the future or otherwise unknown events. Machine learning in waste water enables a huge amount of data to be processed to generate accurate predictions. It was used to generate high-performing energy cost models for wastewater treatment plants.This way we can reduce the water pollution.
